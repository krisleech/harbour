Add timeout to pid, since the port may be open but no pid from lsof. Doing this will also allow the sleep(2) to be removed from start_server! in specs.
add a self.all_ports which lists all open ports, maybe returning Port objects.
raise exceptions instead of returning nil
add commands for linux, it should allow other OS's to be added as well.
Work out if there is a better way to test
